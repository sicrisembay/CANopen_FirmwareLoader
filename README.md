# CANopen Firmware Loader 
This is an application written using C# to load a firmware image in Intel hex format to a CANopen node with bootloader.  I mainly
use this application to test my bootloader project ([CANopenNode_C2000_bootloader](https://github.com/sicrisembay/CANopenNode_C2000_bootloader)).
